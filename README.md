# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Numeric Representations of Words

### One-hot Embedding
### Frequency-based Embedding

* Count
  
* Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Scores
  
* Co-occurrence Matrices
### Predicton-based Embedding
 - Captures meaning and semantic relationships that a word might have with its neighboring words. 
 - Low dimensional representation. 
 - Generated using machine learning algorithms, generally unsupervised learning, that are trained on a huge corpus of text data. 
 - Two popular ones are: 
   - Word2Vec
   - GloVe
